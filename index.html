        Calculating the Slope of a Line
    </h1>
    <p>
        The slope of a line is a measurement of how slanted a line is.
        <hr>
        Positive slope means the line is increasing in height as you read the graph from left to right.
        <hr>
        Negative slope means the line is decreasing in height as you read the graph from left to right.<hr>
    </p>
    <p>
        <h1>How is slope measured?</h1>
        To measure a line's slope, place two points on the line. Then measure the height and length between the two points.<br>
        Slope is a measurement of the height divided by the length. Don't forget slope is positive or negative and we will need to indicate if our line is going upwards or downwards.<hr>
    </p>
    <p>
        Example 1:<br>
        The image below shows a slope going downwards, therefore negative. Between the endpoints, there is a box drawn and measurements made of how many boxes long each piece is; height and length. The slope id a ratio of tall over long.

        Example 3: The image below shows a slope going upwards, therefore positive.

    <p>
        Example 4: The image below shows a slope going upwards, therefore positive.

    <p>
        Slope is calculated in the same way each time. Remember to add a negative sign if the slope is negative. If the slope is positive we do not put a + sign infont of the answer. It is implied the number is positive when no plus sign is infront of a number.
